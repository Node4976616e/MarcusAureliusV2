          <h2>What is Stoic Philosophy ?</h2>

          <p>
            Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of
            Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. It is a philosophy of
            personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the
            natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the
            path to eudaimonia (happiness, or blessedness) is found in accepting
            the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be
            controlled by the desire for pleasure or by the fear of pain, by
            using one's mind to understand the world and to do one's part in
            nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly
            and justly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Stoics are especially known for teaching that "virtue is the
            only good" for human beings, and those external things—such as
            health, wealth, and pleasure—are not good or bad in themselves
            (adiaphora), but have value as "material for virtue to act upon".
            Alongside Aristotelian ethics, the Stoic tradition forms one of the
            major founding approaches to virtue ethics.[1] The Stoics also held
            that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment,
            and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called
            prohairesis) that is "in accordance with nature". Because of this,
            the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy
            was not what a person said but how a person behaved.[2] To live a
            good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order
            since they thought everything was rooted in nature.

          <h1>Marcus Aurelius</h1>
          <h2>Name</h2>
          <p>
            Name Marcus was born in Rome on 26 April 121. His name at birth was
            supposedly Marcus Annius Verus, but some sources assign this name to
            him upon his father's death and unofficial adoption by his
            grandfather, upon his coming of age, or at the time of his
            marriage.He may have been known as Marcus Annius Catilius Severus,
            at birth or some point in his youth,or Marcus Catilius Severus
            Annius Verus. Upon his adoption by Antoninus as heir to the throne,
            he was known as Marcus Aelius Aurelius Verus Caesar and, upon his
            ascension, he was Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus until his
            death; Epiphanius of Salamis, in his chronology of the Roman
            emperors On Weights and Measures, calls him Marcus Aurelius Verus.
          </p>
          <h2>Family origins</h2>
          <p>
            Marcus's paternal family was of Roman Italo-Hispanic origins. His
            father was Marcus Annius Verus (III).[23] The gens Annia was of
            Italian origins (with legendary claims of descendance from Numa
            Pompilius) and a branch of it moved to Ucubi, a small town south
            east of Córdoba in Iberian Baetica.[24][25] This branch of the
            Aurelii based in Roman Spain, the Annii Veri, rose to prominence in
            Rome in the late 1st century AD. Marcus's great-grandfather Marcus
            Annius Verus (I) was a senator and (according to the Historia
            Augusta) ex-praetor; his grandfather Marcus Annius Verus (II) was
            made patrician in 73–74.[26] Through his grandmother Rupilia, Marcus
            was a member of the Nerva-Antonine dynasty; the emperor Trajan's
            sororal niece Salonia Matidia was the mother of Rupilia and her
            half-sister, Hadrian's wife Sabina

          <h1>Writings</h1>
          <h2>Meditations</h2>
          <p>
            While on campaign between 170 and 180, Marcus wrote his Meditations
            in Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. The
            original title of this work, if it had one, is unknown.
            'Meditations' – as well as other titles including 'To Himself' –
            were adopted later.
          </p>

          <p>
            He had a logical mind and his notes were representative of Stoic
            philosophy and spirituality. Meditations is still revered as a
            literary monument to a government of service and duty. According to
            Hays, the book was a favourite of Christina of Sweden, Frederick the
            Great, John Stuart Mill, Matthew Arnold, and Goethe, and is admired
            by modern figures such as Wen Jiabao and Bill Clinton.[318] It has
            been considered by many commentators to be one of the greatest works
            of philosophy.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not known how widely Marcus's writings were circulated after
            his death. There are stray references in the ancient literature to
            the popularity of his precepts, and Julian the Apostate was well
            aware of his reputation as a philosopher, though he does not
            specifically mention Meditations.
          </p>
          <p>
            It survived in the scholarly traditions of the Eastern Church and
            the first surviving quotes of the book, as well as the first known
            reference of it by name ('Marcus's writings to himself') are from
            Arethas of Caesarea in the 10th century and in the Byzantine Suda
            (perhaps inserted by Arethas himself). It was first published in
            1558 in Zurich by Wilhelm Xylander (ne Holzmann), from a manuscript
            reportedly lost shortly afterwards.[321] The oldest surviving
            complete manuscript copy is in the Vatican library and dates to the
            14th century.[322]
